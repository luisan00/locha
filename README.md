The Locha Mesh is a radio network for off-grid messaging, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
transactions could be possible without access to the Internet. We are implementing and inproving the protocol and developing the firmware for affordable devices like the ```Turpial```,
```Harpia```, or their DIY equivalents. 

We adhere to open source ethos at every step and aim to make this tool as decentralized as possible so users can transmit with freedom.

## Backers

### Become a backer

## Getting started

In this page you will find all the information related to the progress of the project, in two languages, [Spanish](./documentation/ES/implementacion.MD), and [English](./documentation/EN/implementation.MD). This work is still under development stage, but all days we are updating the information to expose all the progress about the project

The Locha Mesh is under active development. If you are a C/C++ developer and you want to join the development efforts, or you are a maker and would like to setup the development kits to have them ready for when the firmwares are ready, or if you are a phreaker and you want to hack new ways for decentralized communications, please follow the instructions below on how to get started.

* You need to acquire a Turpial device (currently only available as a [pre-order](https://locha.io/buy)); or [compatible development hardware](https://github.com/btcven/rdymac/blob/master/documents/turpial-description.md) which is comprised of an ESP32 and a radio module.

* Once you have the hardware you need to follow the instructions on [how to flash the ESP32](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware#getting-started), and [how to flash the radio module](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware#getting-started); If you want to collaborate in transcription in other different languages, you are welcome.

* If you need help, please join our Telegram group [here](https://t.me/Locha_io).

## What's in the code?

* The first application that communicates with the Turpial devices can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/locha-mesh-chat).

* Our firmware for the Turpial boards (ESP32) can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware).

* Our firmware for the radio modules can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware).

* The routing protocol and code for the mesh network can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware).

* You can find a Locha Mesh simulator, datasheets, and more in the
[Bitcoin Venezuela organization](https://github.com/btcven).
